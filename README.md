**Status:** 🚧 Under Active Development (Phase 1: Core Implementation)

## Overview

sqlite-graph is an alpha-stage graph database library that combines the reliability of SQLite with the expressiveness of a fluent query API. Built with TypeScript and designed for performance, it provides an intuitive way to model and query connected data.

**Current Status:** Alpha - core functionality working, but not recommended for production use yet.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 **Fluent Query DSL** - Intuitive method chaining for complex graph queries
- 📊 **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support with generic types
- ⚡ **High Performance** - Optimized indexes and prepared statements
- 🔄 **ACID Transactions** - Built on SQLite's transaction system
- 🎯 **Graph Algorithms** - Shortest path, traversal, pattern matching
- 🛠️ **Universal Schema** - Flexible JSON properties for any data model
- 🔮 **Future WASM Support** - Path to Rust optimization when needed

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { GraphDatabase } from 'sqlite-graph';

// Initialize database
const db = new GraphDatabase('./graph.db');

// Create nodes
const job = db.createNode('Job', {
  title: 'Senior Engineer',
  status: 'active',
  url: 'https://example.com/job/123'
});

const company = db.createNode('Company', {
  name: 'TechCorp',
  industry: 'SaaS'
});

// Create relationship (natural syntax: job POSTED_BY company)
db.createEdge(job.id, 'POSTED_BY', company.id);

// Query with fluent API
const activeJobs = db.nodes('Job')
  .where({ status: 'active' })
  .connectedTo('Company', 'POSTED_BY')
  .orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
  .limit(10)
  .exec();

// Graph traversal
const similarJobs = db.traverse(job.id)
  .out('SIMILAR_TO')
  .filter(node => node.properties.status === 'active')
  .maxDepth(2)
  .toArray();

// Shortest path
const path = db.traverse(job.id)
  .shortestPath(anotherJob.id);

// Merge operations (upsert)
const { node, created } = db.mergeNode('Company',
  { name: 'TechCorp' },  // Match criteria
  { industry: 'SaaS', size: 'Large' }  // Properties to set
);

// Note: Advanced concurrency features planned for future releases
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install sqlite-graph
```

## Use Cases

### Job Application Pipeline
Track job applications, companies, skills, and their relationships:

```typescript
const db = new GraphDatabase('./jobs.db', {
  schema: {
    nodes: {
      Job: { properties: ['title', 'url', 'status'] },
      Company: { properties: ['name', 'industry', 'size'] },
      Skill: { properties: ['name', 'category'] }
    },
    edges: {
      POSTED_BY: { from: 'Job', to: 'Company' },
      REQUIRES: { from: 'Job', to: 'Skill' },
      SIMILAR_TO: { from: 'Job', to: 'Job' }
    }
  }
});

// Find similar jobs to rejected applications
const recommendations = db.nodes('Application')
  .where({ status: 'rejected' })
  .with('APPLIED_TO')
  .connectedTo('Job', 'SIMILAR_TO')
  .filter({ status: 'discovered' })
  .exec();
```

### Knowledge Graph
Build wikis, documentation systems, or personal knowledge bases with rich relationships.

### Social Networks
Model users, posts, and relationships with efficient graph queries.

### Dependency Management
Track software dependencies, versions, and relationships.

## Development Methodology

This project uses the **SPARC methodology** (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) with [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) for AI-powered development orchestration.

**Current Phase:** Core Implementation (Phase 1)

Recent progress includes Database class, Transaction support, NodeQuery and TraversalQuery implementations, path finding with cycle detection, and savepoint functionality.

See [SPARC-DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/SPARC-DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed methodology documentation.
