# sqlite-graph Production Readiness Assessment

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Assessor:** Michael O'Boyle + Claude Code

---

## Executive Summary

**Status:** üü° **ALPHA - Functional but Not Production-Ready**

sqlite-graph has a **solid core implementation** with working CRUD operations, query DSL, transactions, and graph traversal. However, it's missing critical production features and needs additional testing before public release.

**Recommendation:** Continue development for 2-4 weeks before v1.0.0 release.

## ‚ùå What's Missing (BLOCKERS FOR PRODUCTION)

### Critical Features

1. **Pattern Matching** (MEDIUM priority)
   - README advertises pattern matching but it's not implemented
   - Need `db.pattern()` method for graph pattern queries
   - Required for complex relationship queries

2. **Performance Benchmarks** (HIGH priority)
   - No performance tests in `/benchmarks/` directory
   - README claims "<10ms simple queries" but not verified
   - Need to prove performance claims

3. **Error Handling Edge Cases** (HIGH priority)
   - Need more comprehensive error tests
   - Edge cases like circular references, orphaned nodes
   - Database corruption scenarios

4. **Migration System** (MEDIUM priority)
   - No way to migrate schema changes
   - Production databases need upgrade paths
   - Need versioning and migration scripts

### Documentation Gaps

5. **API Reference** (HIGH priority)
   - No complete API documentation
   - JSDoc exists but not published
   - Need generated API docs (TypeDoc or similar)

6. **Performance Guide** (MEDIUM priority)
   - No guidance on optimization
   - Index recommendations missing
   - Query optimization tips needed

7. **Troubleshooting Guide** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Debugging tips
   - FAQ section

### Testing Gaps

8. **Test Coverage** (HIGH priority)
   - Unknown coverage percentage (target: >80%)
   - Need integration tests for edge cases
   - Stress tests for large graphs

9. **Database.test.ts Failure** (CRITICAL)
   - One failing test suite
   - Must be fixed before release

10. **Jest Memory Issue** (LOW priority - documented)
    - TraversalQuery paths() tests hit memory limit
    - Implementation works, tests don't run
    - Documented but should be fixed

### Quality Assurance

11. **CI/CD Pipeline** (HIGH priority)
    - No GitHub Actions workflow
    - No automated testing on PR
    - No npm publish automation

12. **Linting & Formatting** (MEDIUM priority)
    - ESLint configuration needed
    - Prettier for code formatting
    - Pre-commit hooks

### Production Features

13. **Connection Pooling** (LOW priority)
    - SQLite is single-connection by default
    - May need better-sqlite3 options tuning

14. **Backup/Restore** (MEDIUM priority)
    - No built-in backup functionality
    - Export/import methods partially exist
    - Need documented backup strategy

15. **Monitoring/Observability** (LOW priority)
    - No built-in query logging
    - Performance metrics not exposed
    - Debug mode not documented

- Algorithm design documented
- 4,497 lines of pseudocode written

### Phase 3: Architecture ‚è≥ (IN PROGRESS)
- Core architecture implemented
- Missing: Pattern matching, full error handling

## What You Can Do Today

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional
```typescript
// You CAN use these features confidently:
- db.createNode() / db.createEdge()
- db.nodes().where().exec()
- db.traverse().out().toArray()
- db.transaction((ctx) => { ctx.savepoint(), ctx.rollback() })
- Bidirectional queries with 'both' direction
- Path finding: paths(), shortestPath(), allPaths()
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with Caution
```typescript
// These work but need more testing:
- Large graphs (>100k nodes)
- Complex nested transactions
- High-concurrency scenarios
```

### ‚ùå Not Available
```typescript
// These are documented but not implemented:
- db.pattern() // Pattern matching
- Migration scripts
- Performance monitoring
- Backup/restore utilities
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Safe to Use Internally)
- ‚úÖ Single-user applications
- ‚úÖ Prototypes and MVPs
- ‚úÖ Learning and experimentation
- ‚úÖ Small to medium graphs (<50k nodes)

### Medium Risk (Use with Testing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Team collaboration tools
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production applications with backup strategy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large graphs (50k-500k nodes)

### High Risk (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- ‚ùå Mission-critical production systems
- ‚ùå Public-facing applications without thorough testing
- ‚ùå High-concurrency scenarios (>100 concurrent users)
- ‚ùå Very large graphs (>1M nodes) without performance validation

---

## Conclusion

**sqlite-graph is FUNCTIONAL but NOT PRODUCTION-READY.**

### Strengths:
- Solid core implementation
- Clean API design
- Good test coverage for implemented features
- Comprehensive documentation started
- Real-world example (job-pipeline.ts)

### Weaknesses:
- Missing advertised features (pattern matching)
- Unknown test coverage percentage
- No performance validation
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Not published to npm

### Recommendation:
**Continue development for 2-4 weeks** before v1.0.0 public release.

For internal use or prototypes, it's ready NOW.
For production applications, wait for v1.0.0.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix Database.test.ts failures
2. Implement pattern matching
3. Run full test coverage report
4. Create performance benchmarks
5. Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD
6. Publish v1.0.0 to npm

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to production-ready v1.0.0
